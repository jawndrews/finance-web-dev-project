## Web Development Project - Fisca

**About**

For an independent student project, I am developing a full stack web application called Fisca.

Fisca is a web application created for the purpose of member and income management for various organizations. Use cases include sororities & fraternities, gyms, country clubs, non profits, and more. For organizations that need to manage members and/or member fees, this application is for you.

**Technologies Used:**

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for most UI components.

**Users**

There are two distinct types of users: Admins and Members.

Admin Features:
- View/add/edit/remove members
- View/add/edit/remove charges on member accounts
- View organization dashboard with data visualization
- View payment history
- View invoice history

Member Features:
- View account overview
- Make payments
