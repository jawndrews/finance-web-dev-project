**ICT 395, Web Application Project – Developer Requirements and Technologies**

**Phase 1 – 1/14/23**

**Jonathan Andrews**

**Developer requirements:** as a student, implementation capabilities are limited

- Low-to-no-cost implementation
- Framework
- Web server to host web application
- Database to hold data
- Programming languages to implement backend

**Technology stacks considered:**

1. **LAMP:**

1. Linux (OS)
1. Apache (server)
1. MySQL (database)
1. PHP (programming language)

**Pros:** Open source, low-cost, highly documented, flexible, and easy to use

**Cons:** Limited scalability, MySQL is limited with large databases

1. **MERN:**
1. MongoDB (database)
1. js (web framework for Node.js)
1. React (front-end framework)
1. js (server)

**Pros:** Open source, scalable (huge library of modules), cloud-compatible, uses one programming language (JavaScript)

**Cons:** JavaScript can be difficult

**Considerations:**

1. Using LAMP would require me to setup a Linux machine, which would add a layer of complexity to the project (not necessarily complex, but rather steps I would not have to take otherwise).
2. MySQL would require relational database creation including entity-relationship model diagrams, which take a bit of time.
3. I have coursework with LAMP and understand the full stack.
4. I already understand a bit of JavaScript including Express, React, and Node frameworks.
5. MERN stack is scalable and uses one programming language.
6. I have used MERN technologies more recently than LAMP technologies.

**Conclusion:** Considering the drawbacks of using the LAMP stack, despite my prior knowledge, I plan to build the web application using the MERN stack. I have coursework in both LAMP and MERN and would like to further my knowledge of MERN with this project.
