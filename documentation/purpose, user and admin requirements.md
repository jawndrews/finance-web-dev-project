**ICT 395, Web Application Project – Purpose, User and Admin Requirements**

**Phase 1 – 1/14/23**

**Jonathan Andrews**

**Summary:** This web development project will consist of an organizational finance management web application.

**Purpose and audience:** This site will function as a manager and database for member finances of any organization. As features may be limited compared to other CRMs, the target audience is initially towards organizations with less needs than full-fledged businesses. Use cases could include sororities & fraternities, country clubs, gyms, non-profits, and more. In its early stages, this site will be strictly for finance and member management. As the project develops, features could be expanded to include the needs of more complex organizations.

**Goal:** The primary goal of this project is to provide organizations a user-friendly and intuitive way to track necessary income and information about their members; with hopes to increase efficiency and time management. Future goals can be implemented as this will be an ongoing project. Users enjoy having their tasks and requirements all in one site, therefore as the project develops, more requirements can be drafted and implemented to provide more features for the users.

**Users:** Member users and Admin users

**Member User Requirements:** Member portal with limited functionality

1. Create account (admin prompted)
2. Sign in
3. Edit account:
4. personal information
5. password
6. View account balance
7. Make/view payments

**Admin User Requirements:** Member/income management

1. View/add/edit/delete accounts
2. View/add/edit/delete balances on accounts
3. View payment history
4. Create reports
5. Database queries using filtered information
6. View dashboards
7. Pre-determined dashboards including charts and graphs for quick visual representation of the organization's data and progress

**Concerns:**

1. Features will be limited. As mentioned before, this is initially an educational project with limited implementation capabilities.
2. Security: user types must be distinctively separated from each other. Members should not be able to access select features or data that Admins can access. Furthermore, confidential user information, such as payment information, will be dealt with in this application; it is important to carefully address these security concerns.
3. User interface: the system must be intuitive for users, especially considering the audience of simple/small organizations.
4. Scalability: this project is ongoing. Although final deliverables as a student project will be set in stone, the application should be open for scalability in the future.
5. Compatibility: the web application should be compatible with multiple browsers, including mobile devices.
6. There are many concerns with web development and a comprehensive list would be a very long one. For the context and sake of a student project, not all concerns can be addressed, and some may be negated.

**Note:** This document strictly covers target audience and requirements for various users. Separate documentation will discuss developer requirements as well as proper technologies to be used.
